Large Image Experimental Utilities

These are unofficial utilities for Large Image.

These utilities are not tested thoroughly and may not work.

lisource_compare.py
-------------------

Compare how all installed sources can read a specific file.  This has options to get numeric representations of histograms to compare image levels, output thumbnails from different sources, and other tools to analyze how files are interpretted.

tddump_to_tiff.py
-----------------

Use output from ``tifftools dump <file>`` to generate a tiff that functions much the same as the original, though with uncompressed and bland image data.
